# TPI Next Web Tool
⚠️ This tool is inspired by [TMAP TPI NEXT Tool](https://www.tmap.net/building-blocks/test-process-improvement-tpi), all credits to them.

## Description
We in QAMania understand importance of well established testing processes, and we appreciate the work of TMAP team. This tool is a web version of TPI NEXT tool, which allows you to assess your testing process maturity and get recommendations for improvement.
The original TPI Next tool works is an Excel file, which is not very convenient for many users. We decided to create a web version of the tool, which is more user-friendly and accessible.

## How to use
1. Open the tool in your web browser: https://qamania.github.io/TPI-Next/en/index.html
2. Answer the questions in the questionnaire
   1. Be honest and accurate in your answers
   2. Add notes to your answers as often as possible
3. Do not be afraid
   - all data is saved in your web browser using IndexedDB, so you can close the tab and return to it later
   - all your data is private and not shared with anyone. We do not have any backend, so we do not store any data on our servers
4. After you finish the questionnaire, you will see your results for further analysis
5. You can download your results as a csv file or PDF report
